This expirment tests you response time and accuracy of pressing the arrow keys.
It can effectively be used to test and train your fingers for better
    typing control for applications such as video games.

The stimuli is a direction up, down, left, or right in text form:
<- -> /\ \/

The stimuli are presented aftere a random wait time of around 0.25 to 4 seconds.
When the stimuli is presented, the subject will have to identify which arrow key
to press and react quickly.

The subjects number and experiment start time are used to create the filename for
the file that hold the results of teh experiments.

The experiment results are saved in a csv file that records:
Block Number
Trial Number
Response - which direction the subject pressed
Accuracy - wether they pressed the right direction
Response Time - how long it took to respond to the stimulus, records incorrect presses aswell

We can change how many blocks and how many trials we want to run by changing:
#-number of trials and blocks *
nTrials = 10
nBlocks = 3
